Creative Portion Description:
Users can like or dislike a post. Just like how Facebook works.
We are able to have more user interaction in this way and make it interactive.

Continuing with the ‘likes’ and ‘dislikes’, we create sorting from high rating to low rating and
also from newer to older posts. With this, users can see the posts in a certain order and it is much more organized.
The posts with more ‘likes’ will be presented at the top just like how Bloomberg terminal works. In addition,
we can choose to sort our posts based on the date posted. We could sort them in such a way that the newer posts
are shown at the top of the page and the older ones are further down the page.

We make our own CSS posts to make the page very visually appealing, and make sure we have buttons for different
functions such like login. We make it easy to use and comprehend, so that it will be a popular and easy-to-use site.
